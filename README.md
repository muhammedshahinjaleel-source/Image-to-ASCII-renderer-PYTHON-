# Image to ASCII Art

A simple Python script that converts an image to ASCII art and saves it as a text file.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have **Python** and the **Pillow** library:
   ```
   pip install pillow
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python image_to_ascii.py
   ```

3. When prompted, enter the path to your image file (for example: `C:\Users\yourname\Desktop\image.jpg`).

The ASCII art will be saved to the text file location set in the script.
