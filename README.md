# ASCII Art Converter (Tkinter + PIL)

This is a simple Python GUI app that converts images into ASCII art using **Tkinter** for the interface and **Pillow (PIL)** for image processing.

## Features
- Load any image by typing its path into the text box.  
- Converts the image into ASCII art using grayscale values.  
- Displays the ASCII art inside the Tkinter window.  
- Adjustable compression factors for scaling ASCII density.  

## Requirements

```bash

pip install pillow
```
